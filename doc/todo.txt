    - TextStyles.ts
        - a large text document could require a lot of styles and that could use a lot of memory/CPU
            - try to do some profiling to see how much it's actually impacting performance
            - investigate how much style re-use you could do in order to reduce resource usage
            - investigate if making some attributes optional, where undefined = the default improves things
- css
    - extract all style tags before doing any other parsing and combine them with the styles from the user agent style sheet
    - support more css selectors
        - class
        - id
        - [selector] [selector]
        - [selector] > [selector]
    - abstract out the css libraries we are working
        - define all of our own data structures
        - defined all the the functions that we need
        - wrap the node modules that we are using in those functions
        - make sure they return our data structures
        - add useCssProcessor so that different processors can be plugged in
